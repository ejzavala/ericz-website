				<h2>A little bit about me.</h2>

					<p>
						First of all, thanks for stopping by and visiting my site! I am aspiring to become a web developer, and what better place to start than with my very own webpage. There are several more ideas that I want to implement here, so stay tuned to see how this webpage changes. Now, let's start the tour.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						My name is Eric, and I was born and raised in Tupelo, Mississippi. I discovered my passion for web development while pursuing a degree at Mississippi State University. I learned a lot about software developement including architecture, design, deployment, testing, version control, databases, and project management. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Fast forward a few years, and I now have my Bachelor's in Software Engineering. Pretty cool, right? From my education I found that I love creating clean and elegant web pages and testing code. Coding and designing web pages is like putting together a puzzle. It stimulates the imagination and keeps me sharp by solving problems and creating solutions. But not only did I learn the software aspect of computers , but also adopted a computer building hobby!

					<h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
					<p>
						My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.

					<h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
					<p>
						I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.

					<h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
					<p>
						You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.
